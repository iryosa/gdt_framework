### A Framework for Assessing and Updating Photogrammetry-Based Geometric Digital Twins  

Keeping a Geometric Digital Twin up to date is challenging due to changes in the built environment, data acquisition limitations, and the lack of clear evaluation methods. This framework provides a structured approach to assessing geometric model quality, focusing on data quality elements, change detection, and resolution validation.  

Download the Excel files (empty template or example file) to apply the framework to your model.  
**Empty template:** [Empty template](gdt_fr_template.xlsx)
**Example file:** [Example file](gdt_fr_paper.xlsx)

The framework is implemented as the Geometric Digital Twin Assessment Tool, available at: https://gdttool-01.streamlit.app/
